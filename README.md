# Take-home assessment

## Overview
I used a mock API to store the uploaded documents. This can be started by navigating to 'mock-api' and running `json-server --watch src/db.json`

Documents can be searched for by their name. If a document is found, the console will print "Document found!".

Newly uploaded images will display, but are not stored in the mock api, so only their name will appear if the page is refreshed.

Due to time, I wasn't able to polish as much as I'd hoped but thank you for considering me as an applicant!
