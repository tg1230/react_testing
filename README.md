## Overview
In this testing, I wanted to experiment with a mock API to store uploaded documents. The mock API can be started by navigating to 'mock-api' and running `json-server --watch src/db.json`

Documents can be searched for by their name. If a document is found, the console will print "Document found!".

Newly uploaded images will display, but are not stored in the mock api, so only their name will appear if the page is refreshed.
